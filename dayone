GIT
git is a version control system (look at previous versions, collaborate, etc.)
committing code is like saving the version. 

GITHUB is a git repository. You can use git without it, but github is good. 

To intitialize an empty git repository in a directory, use command: git init
A git repository has a .git file when you do command ls -la (reveal hidden files). The existance of this file determines if it is a git repository or not.(remove by rm -rf .git)

After initializing git, you need to commit/track files. 
git status shows what has happened, what needs to be committed, etc. 

GIT FILE STATES
untracked: cannot be committed yet
unstaged:
staged:
committed:

Make files staged (ready to commit) by using command git add <file>. git add . adds the whole current directory. 

use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage

to commit: git commit -m "___"
-m is the message. 

git log: checks commits


git reset --soft/hard HEAD^
soft: reverses the commit
hard: reverses the commit and the changes made
^: the number of commits ago 

git doesn't care about empty directories. There needs to be files to be tracked. 


in order to push and pull from github use commands:
git push origin master
git pull origin master


to create a copy of it on your computer:
git clone <url>
